## Intro

Construct a square matrix with a size N Ã— N containing integers from 1 to N * N in a spiral order, starting from top-left and in clockwise direction.

## Example

For n = 3, the output should be

solution(n) = 

    [[1, 2, 3],
    [8, 9, 4],
    [7, 6, 5]]

for n = 6, the output should be

solution(n) = 

       [[1,2,3,4,5,6], 
	   [20,21,22,23,24,7], 
	   [19,32,33,34,25,8], 
	   [18,31,36,35,26,9], 
	   [17,30,29,28,27,10], 
	   [16,15,14,13,12,11]]
